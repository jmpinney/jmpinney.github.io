title: Where is Everyone? Alien Life and Why No One Returns Our Calls
---
Humanity has long gazed into the sky, imagining the heavens, canals on Mars or cities on Venus. Especially now we focus much of our attention on it, telescopes pointed into space, ostensibly for the purpose of furthering science, but the real reason we are looking through the lens, is we are anxious to see how far the darkness goes. Are we alone? Is anyone out there? Discovering extraterrestrial life could be terrifying, but by far more terrifying would be being alone. Of the innumerable stars in the universe, _someone_ _else_ must be out there. Right?

By now everyone knows the Drake equation, which says that life in the universe should be fairly commonplace. The equation has its problems and is based on widely conjectural values but still; in a universe of basically (for our purposes) infinite size, you’d think there’d be someone else around, or radio signals we could intercept or _something_. The scale of the universe and probability alone suggests that.

But instead we find ourselves alone in a barren expanse, searching the stars for signals of life from far off civilizations that don’t seem to exist. Enrico Fermi asked “Where is everyone?” giving rise to the famous Fermi paradox and the concept of the Great Filter which says perhaps life is commonplace but doesn’t last very long because some tragedy or another befalls a civilization. We can wax endlessly about possible great filters because all we have is speculation and our own track record to look at. Humanity may even be facing a great filter of our own in how we’ve dramatically changed our climate in only the past few hundred years.

So where are all the aliens? We have a few scenarios here:

1.  Microbial life is the most common kind of life across the universe, but the leap to intelligence is rare.
    
2.  There were advanced civilizations in the past, but they are gone now.
    
3.  We just happen to be the singular planet on which life has developed.
    
4.  We have a head start on everyone else.
    
5.  They’re out there, but we’re in a galactic backwater and faster than light or near light speed travel is not possible or yet to be created by anyone.
    

Scenario 3 sucks — there is simply no way _some_ sort of life hasn’t developed on another planet in the past 13 billion years. The only thing scarier than potentially hostile extraterrestrials is being completely and utterly alone in the universe. To be alone in a universe of inconceivable size is … inconceivable. Given how we’ve treated our planet and the life under our stewardship, it would be devastating to know we’ve befouled the _only_ place life exists in the cosmos. I simply refuse to believe it, unless somehow we manage to find irrefutable proof. Even then I think I would put my hands over my ears. It would be a tragedy on a truly cosmic scale.

But it is a distant possibility, I admit.

Happily, I think the rest of the scenarios are far more probable, and the truth is likely a mixture of them.

In scenario one, microbial life is plentiful. We know that specialized microbes (extremophiles) can survive and thrive in just about any environment on Earth whether that environment has scorching highs, frigid lows, corrosive acids, caustic bases, or crunching pressures. The toughest microbe we know is _Deinococcus radiodurans_ which survived the vacuum of space for 3 years on the IIS, resistant to extreme cold, ionizing radiation, the vacuum of space, desiccation and is probably in the .01% of germs that hand sanitizer does not kill. It’s not hard to imagine similar organisms existing beneath the ground on Mars or swimming in the seas of Europa.

_Deinococcus radiodurans, probably_

It’s a difficult hypothesis to prove or disprove though, mainly due to A) The lack of evidence so far of life of any kind on Mars and B) Our limited ability to detect microbes across space. We can use spectrometers to determine the general make up of far away atmospheres, looking for planets that seem like they could support life, but nothing yet exists that is sensitive enough to pick up faint biomarkers, and even when a suspected biomarker is discovered, it is difficult to determine whether it’s from geochemical or biological processes. That said, I think we have a good chance at discovering microbial life right here in our own solar system and if so, there is a good chance it is abundant elsewhere. My opinion is that one of Fermi’s great filter happens here — most microbes out there are probably extremophiles, and as such, not many microbes are able to make the leap into complex multicellular life due to extreme conditions they thrive in. Earth-like Goldilocks conditions are not necessarily needed for microbial life to arise (our own microbial ancestors evolved in the nightmarish hellscape of early earth, for example), but for complex life as we know it, are absolutely required.

Scenario 2 is a classic trope of sci-fi, that highly advanced ancient alien civilizations have collapsed, or have been wiped out due to some unknown and mysterious factors. Again this is hard to disprove or prove, leaving us with only speculation. Perhaps there are huge periodic gamma ray bursts that effectively sterilize entire galaxies every couple billion years, or once civilization gets to a certain point, it is noticed by other, hostile civilizations and destroyed. This doesn’t contradict scenario 1 and is entirely plausible, if not more than a little disconcerting.

Scenario 4 is one not often considered, because of the incredible conceit of imagining we are one of the first, or the first, planets to contain intelligent life, but consider this: the universe is about 13.5 billion years old. For the first billion years, the universe was nothing but clouds of hydrogen collapsing in on each other. There were no metals or elements heavier than hydrogen and helium until the first stars formed. These stars, called population 3 stars eventually produced heavier elements that led to the formation of metal poor population 2 stars, which eventually gave way to metal rich population 1 stars, like our sun, about 10 billion years ago. The building blocks of life simply did not exist before population 1 stars. Thus we can be fairly sure that no life existed anywhere for the first 3.5 billion years of the universe. Our own sun is young, only 4.6 billion years old, and the earliest fossil evidence we have for life on earth is estimated to be 3.7 billion years old, suggesting it arose rather quickly after the formation of the solar system. It took another 2 billion years for eukaryotic cells to emerge (about 1.8 billion years ago), and another 800 million after that for them to crawl of the ocean and onto land.

Dinosaurs first appeared about 200 million years ago and mammals about 160 million years ago. Humans appeared only 315,000 years ago, and it took us 305,000 years to actually get to the point where we could start to be considered “intelligent.”

Assuming we’re typical, the earliest life can emerge is about 900 million years (lets call it a billion to make math easy) after a star is formed, and takes about another 4 billion years to sufficiently evolve to where we are today. So from start to finish, star formation to intelligent life, about 5 billion years.

Assuming that the first population 1 star emerged 10 billion years ago, it’s possible that the earliest intelligent life in the universe could have evolved about 5 billion years ago, only 1.3 billion years earlier than life emerged on our own planet. In the cosmic scheme of things, not a very long time. (In addition, take into consideration scenario 1, that actually reaching the complex life stage is probably fairly rare to begin with). Star formation, and thus the potential for new life to arise, is estimated to continue for at least another 140 billion years. Humanity is potentially one of the first of many intelligent species that will develop in the universe over time. We’re just early to the party.

Scenario 5 is also very plausible. We might be in a rural galactic backwater where no one bothers to come because it’s so far out of the way. The majority of life may exist closer to the galactic center, where the stars are older than ours and the stellar density is greater. (Well, not the actual center, actually. More like “slightly closer than we are.” I’m using the galactic center as kind of an easy visualization and for easy math, but the center is expected to be less hospitable to life due to the stellar density and gamma rays and that kind of stuff. Thank god this isn’t peer reviewed.) We’re 25,000 light years away from the galactic center so any kind of interaction with life there, even radio signals, is probably not going to happen. Potentially there is another earth like planet in the region right now, with inhabitants straining to hear and be heard by anyone who is out there. Our oldest radio signals in space have only traveled a measly 92 light years away. They would take 24,908 years to reach this hypothetical civilization, and another 25,000 years for us to get a reply.

Without hypothetical faster than light travel, even traveling to Proxima Centauri, the closest solar system to us at 4.6 light years away, is a nonstarter at 76,000 years with currently achievable speeds, although decently fast communication is theoretically possible, with a roundtrip time of 8 years. Near light speed travel could reduce the trip length to about 5 years, but we are far from developing the requisite technology. Even at light speed, unconstrained by physics, the farthest we could likely venture out is 50 light years, and the trip would effectively last a lifetime for the persons on board. Not impossible per say, but unlikely it is something we could achieve in the next few hundred years.

Furthermore, our entire galaxy and local group is effectively in a universal backwater, a vast empty region of space named the KBC void, one of the largest known in the universe. Not that it matters though, because travel between galaxies is a nut we will probably never be able to crack.

In short, I believe that the apparent dearth of intelligent life in the universe is due to the probable rarity of microbial organisms evolving into more complex life forms due to environmental factors, us arriving comparatively early in the overall lifespan of the universe, and the as of now insurmountable distance between solar systems preventing any meaningful long distance communication.

At the very least, microbial life is probably very common and we can take solace in the fact that it will be discovered within our lifetime in our own proverbial backyard, provided we don’t inflict a self imposed great filter on ourselves. Even the knowledge a lone bacterium exists under some dusty rock somewhere other than earth is enough to prove that we are not alone in the vast and insurmountable vacuum of the universe.
