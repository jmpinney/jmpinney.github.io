title: Thoughts on Information Gathering as the Purpose of Consciousness
---
Armchair philosophizing here. This will be bullet point-ish format and is not really supposed to be a coherent “argument,” but more like philosophic rhapsodizing on my part. If it’s well received I will try to flesh the theories out more.

Consciousness is an emergent property of the structure of the brain. Each individual consciousness is a tiny part of the universe attempting to understand itself in a different way. The perspectives of the genius and the layman or the idiot and the savant are all equally important, and contribute to the overall body of our understanding of the world, and thus to the universes understanding of itself.

The universe, or the natural world, contains far more information than any one individual could comprehend. I think a major contender for the purpose of existence and consciousness is to obtain information and pass it down in different ways.

The indisputable purpose of all life is to reproduce and pass down genetic information, that’s why genes exist. The only reason I think sentience exists is to facilitate the passing down of even more information. DNA and RNA were no longer sufficient, and natural selection gave rise to complex consciousness, language and culture, which can encode far more information, which conferred an evolutionary advantage to our species

Much like non-sentient life, the purpose of sentient life is to learn, retain, and disseminate additional information.

Humanity has been endowed with individual consciousness, and a collective consciousness facilitated by language and culture. We’ve overcome the information capacity and processing limitations of genetic material, which may be the greatest feat of natural selection ever.

Each individual collects more knowledge and understanding of the natural world. Much like how genetic material is only passed down by those who have reproduced, only information that has passed down in the form of oral or written communication survives the death of an individual. This confers an advantage not only to the individual, but all individuals that make up the collective of humanity. Reproduction is not needed to pass this information down. This is a major change in how information has been passed down for billions of years.

The knowledge gained by an individual remains in the collective if it has been disseminated properly. Science is a great example of this — it builds on the works of individuals, many of whom are deceased but the knowledge they disseminated lives with us and forms important parts of the overall scientific corpus and modern society.

That is not to say a persons experiences, emotions, relationships and non-disseminated knowledge are unimportant in the grand scheme of things — they are the facts and facets of life that can only be uniquely experienced by each individual at specific points in time.

Effectively this results in two kinds of knowledge that consciousness provides- that which can be shared and is shared — we’ll call collective knowledge — and knowledge cannot be shared, written down or communicated effectively, which we’ll go ahead and call intimate knowledge.

This intimate knowledge, throwing off religious connotations it implies, could effectively be considered an individuals soul, if information gathering is the purpose of life. Sentience, self awareness, your emotions and experiences constitute your soul. The soul is simply the information you can’t write down. It disappears on death and fades back into the background of the universe.

Consider this: your brain is a unique structure of atoms and out of that structure, consciousness and awareness arises. As the atoms that form the structure break apart and separate, the consciousness disappears. They will never come together again in the same exact way. But even if they did, and a new consciousness came into existence once more, it would have no way of knowing about the past. That information is simply lost, being dependent on the structure of the brain.

Do you remember what it was like before you were born? The answer is no. After death, could you remember what it was like to be alive? The answer is no.

The soul only exists at a specific instance in time and that specific instance only — it did not exist before your awareness, and it will not exist after your awareness. The soul, while fleeting, is at the core of human experience and existence. By communicating, writing down things and disseminating information and theories, parts of the individual soul are added to the collective soul of humanity and live on.

We have at present generated more collective knowledge than can be sifted through and analyzed by us, and have exhausted our capacity to manage it effectively. This is what has spurned the creation of artificial intelligence — we need something that has the capacity to process and create connections in the expansive body of collective human knowledge. If bits of each individual soul exists in the collective soul, and the collective soul is the body of information collected by all of humanity, then it can be reasonably inferred that once it is advanced enough, artificial intelligence will be representative of the soul of humanity, and is yet another step towards facilitating the gathering, processing and dissemination of knowledge.
